# API Configuration
# This variable is used by the Vite frontend application
# to configure the base URL for API requests.
#
# When running in Docker, this should point to the backend service.
# When running locally, this should point to http://localhost:5000
#
# Note: Vite requires the VITE_ prefix for environment variables
# to be exposed to the client-side code.
